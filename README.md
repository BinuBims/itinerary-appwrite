# Itinerary Web App with Apprwrite Backend
Created an itinearry app to share people's itenaries when they travel to different contries and different citites. I had a really hard time to craeting an itenaries when i planned a trip to Thailand. I know that a lot of people travel there too and it is too complicated
figure things out. so i build a webapp where people can share their iternaries for each day and the hotels they stayed add. the data was stored in appwrite.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Appwrite and Vite

once you fork the repo. run npm install and then run npm run dev. also you want to have your appwrite backend setup to add and itenaries

## Optimizations

Right now anyone can enter any information to the database. I want to add a function where people can login so they can have a dashboard to enter their itenaries. also added backend option where people can uploade images. also an option that user can rate other people;s
itinearries and like and share them with other users.

## Lessons Learned:

A lot of javascript to learn. as the page dynamically changes based on the number of days each itenaries are.it was easy to setup the backend with appwrite. had to learn async and wait. eventloop. prevent default reoload. also it was really annoying to do changes and load 
components with pure javascript. i should have look into React or other frontend framework.
